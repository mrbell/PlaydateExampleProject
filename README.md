First project getting to know the [Playdate SDK](https://sdk.play.date/1.11.0/Inside%20Playdate.html).

Started with the project template found [here](https://github.com/Whitebrim/VSCode-PlaydateTemplate) and followed the helpful ["Getting Started with the Playdate SDK" video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ufxinp7No).

The project is set up such that running the "Run Build Task" (Ctrl-Shift-B) compiles the game and sends to the emulator automatically, thanks to the project template linked above.

Using [Piskel](piskelapp.com/) to create sprites.

I'm starting with the basic game idea from that video... moving a character to pick up a coin, tracking the number of coins collected within a fixed time limit as a score... but tweaking. Adding in randomly positioned obstacles, for instance. 

To do:
- [ ] Bound player to the screen (now they can run off the edge)
- [X] Add rocks (obstacles) as sprites with random locations and collisions
- [ ] Add walking animation
- [ ] Add acceleration and momentum
- [ ] Keep a high score, display when game is over
- [ ] Make the pie move
- [ ] Add moving obstacles
